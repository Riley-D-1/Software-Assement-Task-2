- This is the "Nuke the board". Unleash it at your own risk (friendships/relationships may be part of the explosion)




## How to Win:
### Last player standing wins
Player elimination:
- Each player starts with 20 hp
- When a player reaches equal to or less than 0 (see attack and defense for how you deal and defend against damage), they are eliminated.
Once eliminated they discard all cards and take no further action.




*(If playing in a group, continue to score everyone 1 and the person who got the knockout 2) Also work out a number of games and play rock paper scissors if there is a tie when you want to finish.


## Combat and defense
On your turn, you may attack once with a **Number Card** in your hand. Your opponent may defend with a fighter card in own hand.


If no defense is played (or they can't play a defence):
- The attacker's face value is subtracted from the opponent's HP.


If a defense is played :
- Compare face value
- The weakest card is deceased (Goes to Discard pile)
- Tied? Both cards die ( Both to Discard pile)
- Strongest card survives and stays on the battlefield.
1 attack per turn.


## Additional Rules:
If you reach the bottom of your pile simply shuffle all cards in the discard and place them face down in your draw pile and then continue playing
