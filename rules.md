# Joker's Judgement Rules
## Setup:
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Split the deck (with the Jokers) evenly for all the players.
3. Place the evenly split deck in each player's draw pile face down.
4. Each Player will now draw 3 Cards keeping them hidden from the other players
5. Decide who is going first. This is the player's choice but an easy way to decide is the person to the right of the person who shuffled the deck.
6. Use some kind of counter (Dice is a good option) to keep track of everyone HP which starts on 20.
## Gameplay:
On your turn:
1. Draw 1 card from your pile (This will be auto done in my game)
2. Play 1 card from your hand (See rules below about attack and defending)

Play continues clockwise.

# Meet the cards!
## Fighter Cards (2-10, A)
#### Number Cards (2-10):
- Each face value is their vaule. (See attack and defence)
- These are your core fighters. They are very common but very important to winning

#### Ace (A):
- Worth 10 in vaule
- Stronger than most, he's a big boi juggernaut who is almost unkillable
## Ability Cards (K, Q, J, Joker)
#### King (K):
- You deal 5 damage to the opponet.
-  Careful, might take some damage of your own in the process.
#### Queen (Q):
- Heals for 5 hp.
- Probably the most important card so use her wisely.
#### Jack (J):
- Draw 2 cards when played
- Reinforcements galore!
#### Joker (Chaos GOD)
- When played it's a board wipe
- **All cards in player's hands** are discarded
- HP and draw piles for the players remains the same
- Your other cards are not taken in cosideration, their effects or damage do not apply.
- This is the "Nuke the board". Unleash it at your own risk (friendships/relationships may be part of the explosion)

## How to Win:
### Last player standing wins
Player elimination:
- Each player starts with 20 hp
- When a player reaches equal to or less than 0 (see attack and defense for how you deal and defend against damage), they lose. If you both lose on the same round play rock paper scissors to decide. (Player loses by default in my game as the artificial intelligence isn't very smart and this leads to a more balanced game)


## Combat and defense
In the round, you both may play a card.

If no number card is played by one of the players :
- Both abillties are used.

If one player plays a number card and the other an ability:
- The player who played the ability gets the abilities effect 
- The player with the number card deals damage to the other player's hp

If both play a number card :
- Compare face value
- The weakest card is deceased (Goes to Discard pile)
- Tied? Both cards die ( Both to Discard pile)
- Strongest card survives and stays on the battlefield.
1 attack per round.


## Additional Rules:
If you reach the bottom of your pile simply shuffle all cards in the discard and place them face down in your draw pile and then continue playing.
