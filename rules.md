1. Setup:
Split the deck (with the Jokers) evenly for all the players
Place the evenly split deck in each players area
Each Player will now draw 3 Cards and can place any normal cards on their board (No Jacks, Jokers,Kings or Queens)
2. Gameplay:
Decide who is going first. This is the players choice but an easy way to decide is the person to the right of the person who shuffled the deck.

3. How to Win:
If a player reached 0 hitpoints they are out. Score everyone with a point and the person who knocked them out 2 points.

4. Additional Rules:
Pick 2 Cards:
Some black cards require players to submit two white cards in a specific order. 
Gambling:
Players can gamble an Awesome Point to submit an additional white card in a round. If they win, they keep their point; if they lose, the winner of the round takes both points. 
No Specific End Goal:
The game is not about winning, but about having fun and finding the funniest combinations of cards.
