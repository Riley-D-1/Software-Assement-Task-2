# Software Assessment Task 2: Joker's Judgement
### A fun and interactive card game (card game made by me) using pygame! 
## Requirements
Pygame:
- A python library for making video games in python.

## How to use the program
1. Firstly if you are reading this on github you will need to open it in a suitable IDE with python 3.11 or higher installed.
2. Simply click the download button or alternatively use github desktop to open it.

3. Next navigate to python's terminal in your IDE and run the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Optional* : If an upgrade pip prompt appears in your terminal, I heavily recommend you update it by copy and pasting the command there.

4. Click the run button in your preferred IDE (In main.py) and then give the program a second.

5. Follow the terminal instructions and open the link. (Shown below)

6. The program is running and you can navigate around the GUI. 

7. Once you are finished click the exit button like you would on a normal window or click the quit button (go to the menu by clicking ESC*)

*Won't work when playing card game, hold alt tab and then move your mouse over the window's X and click to stop it.

## Alternatively

1. Download the repoistry on github by clicking the CODE button before clicking download zip.

2. In your browser locate the downloads and double click on the zip folder. Unzip it using windows inbuilt zip tools.

3. Then open the unzipped file in file explorer and double click on the exe file.

4. You likely will have to say yes, I trust the exe from an unknown publisher. The exe will then run the program without needing any dependicies! (Technically needs the image folder but it will work as long as you dont move the exe away from it)

## Common Errors and Solutions
- Sometimes if you alt tab out of the game you will recieve a small visual glitch. The screen will turn black besides for some of the cards for a brief period of time untill the program does it's next screen refresh.
    - No solution: Just Avoid trying to alt tab while playing the game.

- I don't understand how to play the actual card game. 
    - I have laid out the rules in rules.md and you are able to turn on help hints in options to allow the program to explain what is happening each round and slows down the logic phase.

I made my own much smaller version that was heavily influenced by the asset.
