## How to use the program
1. Firstly if you are reading this on github you will need to open it in a suitable IDE with python 3.11 or higher installed.
2. Simply click the download button or alternatively use github desktop to open it.

3. Next navigate to python's terminal in your IDE and run the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Optional* If an upgrade pip prompt appears in your terminal, I heavily recommend you update it by copy and pasting the command there.

4. Click the run button in your preferred IDE (In main.py) and then give the program a second.

5. Follow the terminal instructions and open the link. (Shown below)


6. The program is running and you can navigate around the GUI. Infomation on how to understand the parameters and API responses are in the Help page. Further infomation about the diffrent NASA data and a reiteration of the programs focus are found on the About page.

7. Once you are finished click into the terminal and then press Ctrl+C at the same time and wait for the errors to stop. Once they finish the locally hosted website has closed. Please note that your history will be saved locally, if you want to clear it after the GUI you can simply delete history.txt's contents. However do not delete the file itself.

## Alternatively 

1. Locate the exe file and click the download icon on github after selecting it.

2. In your browser locate the downloads and double click on the program. 

3. You likely will have to say yes, I trust the exe from an unknown publisher. The exe will then run the GUI which you can navigate around in and use.

## Common Errors and Solutions
Lots of bugs as this is simply a UI you can navigate through. All of the game logic is not functional.
