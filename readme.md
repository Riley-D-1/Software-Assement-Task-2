## How to use the program
1. Firstly if you are reading this on github you will need to open it in a suitable IDE with python 3.11 or higher installed.
2. Simply click the download button or alternatively use github desktop to open it.

3. Next navigate to python's terminal in your IDE and run the following command.

2. In your browser locate the downloads and double click on the zip folder. Unzip it

3. Then open the unzipped file in file explorer and double click on the exe file.

4. You likely will have to say yes, I trust the exe from an unknown publisher. The exe will then run the program without needing any dependicies!

## Common Errors and Solutions
