# Software-Assessment-Task-1
### Data Science Assessment Task: Joker's Judgement
## Objective
TBC


## Features
- 


## Requirements
Pygame:
- A python library for making video games in python.

## How to use the program
1. Firstly if you are reading this on github you will need to open it in a suitable IDE with python 3.11 or higher installed.
2. Simply click the download button or alternatively use github desktop to open it.

3. Next navigate to python's terminal in your IDE and run the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Optional* If an upgrade pip prompt appears in your terminal, I heavily recommend you update it by copy and pasting the command there.

4. Click the run button in your preferred IDE (In main.py) and then give the program a second.

5. Follow the terminal instructions and open the link. (Shown below)

6. The program is running and you can navigate around the GUI. 

7. Once you are finished click the exit button (go to the menu by clicking ESC)

## Alternatively (Not available for the first sprint)

1. Locate the exe file and click the download icon on github after selecting it.

2. In your browser locate the downloads and double click on the program. 

3. You likely will have to say yes, I trust the exe from an unknown publisher. The exe will then run the GUI which you can navigate around in and use.

## Common Errors and Solutions
- Only a UI you can navigate through. All of the game logic is not functional.
- DOES NOT WORK IN OTHER RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE NOT 1080p
