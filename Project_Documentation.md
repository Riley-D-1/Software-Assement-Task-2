### By Riley Dowse
# Sprint 1

## Task Definition 

TBC

## Requirements definition
### Functional requirements 
- Users must be able to verse a bot in a fun and interactive GUI and play Joker's Judgement.
- The system must have random drawing and deck splitting
- The system must be able to track players health and card inventories.
- The system must follow the rules of Joker's judgement
- The system must clearly show who is the winner and loser.


### Non Functional requirements 
- The system must respond quickly to the players actions
- It must load within 3 seconds
- The game must maintain smooth and responsive
- The controls must be simple yet functional and easy to pick up
- Have settings to adapt and modify the user's experience
- The system must be reliable and not crash
- The game should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.
- The game must have clear documentation and install steps.
- The games rules must be clear and understandable.

## Determining Specifications
### Functional Specifications
What does the system actually NEED to do?

User Requirements
-- Users must be able to verse a bot in a fun and interactive GUI and play Joker's Judgement.
- The user needs to be able to input their actions and receive an output by the system informing them of their acitons.

Inputs & Outputs
- The system needs to have clear and responsive inputs that correctly match the users intent.
- The system needs to have simple but clear outputs that clearly display the game state to the user
- The input system has to be logical and easy to understand and pickup

Core Features
- At it's core it needs to provide a fun card game experience that follows the rules of Joker's judgement
- It needs to be an exciting card game played against a challenging but fun bot.
- The system needs to be enticing to a wide variety of players.


User Interaction
- The users will interact with the game in a logical but simple GUI. A detailed readme will explain how to use the program, furthermore the rules of the game will be clearly laid out in a seperate readme.
- The user
Error Handling
- The game will print errors in the terminal and provide game infomation for debugginh purposes.
- I will also list errors with the program in the readme and provide clear and achievable solutions to them
What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?
### Non Functional Specifications

Performance
- The system needs to respond quickly to the users input and be fluid and smooth at all times
- The system must remain at a consitent 60fps
- The system must load all aspects in less than 3 seconds 
How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?

Useability / Accessibility
- My readme and installation guide will make it easy for anyone to install my game and cater to a wide variety of technolgical knowledge levels.
- If I have time I will code more acessibility settings.
How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

Reliability
- I will code clear error messages and adress all 
- The users data does not disclose any personal infomation and will be kept from the AI bot to 

## Use case diagram
Actor: User

Preconditions: A suitable operating system that can run .exe files or alternatively an IDE that can run python files. 

Main Flow:
- Begin - User selects the option to play. 

- Setup – The system equally splits a deck of cards that have 

- Draw Card – User clciks the draw pile 

- Play Card- User selects a number card or an ability card to play

- Attack - User attacks with a number card leading the system to defennd

Postconditions: Turn changes to the system , the user draws a card and play's a card.

## Review
End of Sprint Review Questions
1. Evaluate how effectively your project meets the functional and non-functional requirements defined in your planning.

2. Refer to specific criteria or expectations outlined in your requirements document.

3. Analyse the performance of your program against the key use-cases you identified.

4. Discuss whether the program behaves as expected and handles input/output as planned.

5. Assess the quality of your code in terms of readability, structure, and maintainability.

6. Consider naming conventions, use of functions, comments, and overall organisation.

7. Explain the improvements that should be made in the next stage of development.

8. Include both feature enhancements and refinements to code quality or structure.
