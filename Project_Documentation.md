# Software Eginnering Task 2
### By Riley Dowse
# Sprint 1
## Requirements definition
### Functional requirements 
Consider the following elements when developing your functional requirements. 

Data Retrieval: What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 
The user needs to be able to view


User Interface: What is required for the user to interact with the system?


Data Display: What information does the user need to obtain from the system? What needs to be output for the user?


### Non Functional requirements 
Consider the following elements when developing your non-functional requirements:

Performance: How well does the system need to perform? 

Reliability: How reliable does the system and data need to be?

Usability and Accessibility: How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?
## Determining Specifications
### Functional Specifications
What does the system actually NEED to do?

User Requirements
The 
What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.

Inputs & Outputs
The system will mainly need to accept mouse/touchpad clicks and spacebar and enter. It will need to output diffrent collections of pixel art in order to 
What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?

Core Features
At it's core it needs to provide a fun card game experience that runs.
At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?

User Interaction

How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?
The users will interact with the game in a logical but simple GUI. A detailed readme will explain how to use the program, furthermore 
Error Handling
The game will print errors in the terminal and provide game infomation for debugginh purposes.
What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?
### Non Functional Specifications

Performance

How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?
I need to code the game to remain at a consistent 60fps. 
Useability / Accessibility
If I have time I will code detaileed acessibility settings.
How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

Reliability

What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Illogical calculation? Menu navigation going to wrong places?

## Use case diagram
Example of a Use Case - Rock Collection (REQUIRED)
Actor: User

Preconditions: A suitable operating system that can run .exe files or alternatively python files. 

Main Flow:

Begin - User selects the option to play. (Maybe select difficulty)

Store Rock – User draws

Compare Rocks – User selects rocks; system retrieves and displays comparisons (e.g., hardness, composition, rarity).

Visualise Data – System generates a graph comparing selected rocks.

Remove Rock – User deletes a rock from the collection; system updates storage.

Postconditions: Rock data is retrieved, stored, compared, or removed successfully.

## Review
End of Sprint Review Questions
1. Evaluate how effectively your project meets the functional and non-functional requirements defined in your planning.

2. Refer to specific criteria or expectations outlined in your requirements document.

3. Analyse the performance of your program against the key use-cases you identified.

4. Discuss whether the program behaves as expected and handles input/output as planned.

5. Assess the quality of your code in terms of readability, structure, and maintainability.

6. Consider naming conventions, use of functions, comments, and overall organisation.

7. Explain the improvements that should be made in the next stage of development.

8. Include both feature enhancements and refinements to code quality or structure.
