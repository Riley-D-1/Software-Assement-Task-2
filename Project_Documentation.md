# Software Eginnering Task 2
### By Riley Dowse
# Sprint 1
## Requirements definition
### Functional requirements 
Consider the following elements when developing your functional requirements. 

Data Retrieval: What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 

User Interface: What is required for the user to interact with the system?

Data Display: What information does the user need to obtain from the system? What needs to be output for the user?

### Non Functional requirements 
Consider the following elements when developing your non-functional requirements:

Performance: How well does the system need to perform? 

Reliability: How reliable does the system and data need to be?

Usability and Accessibility: How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?
## Determining Specifications
### Functional Specifications
What does the system actually NEED to do?

User Requirements

What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.

Inputs & Outputs

What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?

Core Features

At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?

User Interaction

How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?

Error Handling

What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?
### Non Functional Specifications

Performance

How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?

Useability / Accessibility

How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

Reliability

What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Illogical calculation? Menu navigation going to wrong places?
## Use case diagram
Example of a Use Case - Rock Collection (REQUIRED)
Actor: User (Geologist / Rock Nerd)

Preconditions: Internet access; API with rock/mineral data is available.

Main Flow:

Search Rock/Mineral – User enters a rock/mineral name (e.g., Obsidian, Quartz); system retrieves and displays details.

Store Rock – User adds the rock to their collection; system confirms storage.

Compare Rocks – User selects rocks; system retrieves and displays comparisons (e.g., hardness, composition, rarity).

Visualise Data – System generates a graph comparing selected rocks.

Remove Rock – User deletes a rock from the collection; system updates storage.

Postconditions: Rock data is retrieved, stored, compared, or removed successfully.

## Review
End of Sprint Review Questions
1. Evaluate how effectively your project meets the functional and non-functional requirements defined in your planning.

2. Refer to specific criteria or expectations outlined in your requirements document.

3. Analyse the performance of your program against the key use-cases you identified.

4. Discuss whether the program behaves as expected and handles input/output as planned.

5. Assess the quality of your code in terms of readability, structure, and maintainability.

6. Consider naming conventions, use of functions, comments, and overall organisation.

7. Explain the improvements that should be made in the next stage of development.

8. Include both feature enhancements and refinements to code quality or structure.
